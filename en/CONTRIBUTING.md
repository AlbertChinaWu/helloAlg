# Contributing guidelines for Chinese-to-English

We are working on translating "Hello Algo" from Chinese to English with the following approach:

1. **AI translation**: Carry out an initial pass of translations using the machine learning translator.
2. **Human touch**: Manually refine the machine-generated outputs to ensure authenticity and accuracy.
3. Repeat step `2.` for further improvements.

## Translation process

> [!tip]
> Before starting, make sure you're familiar with basic Git operations and the GitHub pull request workflow.

1. **Self-assignment**: Visit [GitHub projects](https://github.com/users/krahets/projects/2/views/4), select an unclaimed task, and mark it as `In Progress`.
2. **Translation**: Before starting, ensure you've read the "Translation standards" below. We encourage preserving the original meaning while ensuring the translation is natural and fluent.
3. **Peer review**: Please carefully check your changes before submitting a Pull Request (PR). Once the PR approved by 2 reviewers, your work will be merged into the project.

## Translation standards

> [!tip]
> The "Accuracy" and "Authenticity" below are primarily handled by persons native in Chinese and those native in English, respectively.

**Accuracy**:

- Maintain consistency in terminology across translations by referring to the [Terminology](https://www.hello-algo.com/chapter_appendix/terminology/) section.
- Prioritize technical accuracy and maintain the tone and style of the Chinese version. If you think changing the original meaning is necessary, please first submit a PR to modify the Chinese version.

**Authenticity**:

- Translations should read naturally and fluently, adhering to English expression conventions.
- Always consider the context of the content to harmonize the article.
- Be aware of cultural differences between Chinese and English. For instance, Chinese "pinyin" does not exist in English.

**Formatting**:

- Figures and tables will be automatically numbered during deployment, so DO NOT manually number them.
- Each PR should cover at least one complete document to ensure manageable review sizes, except for bug fixes.

**Collaboration**:

- During the review, please focus primarily on the parts that have changed, and read the context as necessary.
- Learning from each other's perspectives can lead to better translations and more cohesive results.
- Be friendly and supportive of each other.
