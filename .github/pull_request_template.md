If this PR is related to coding or code translation, please fill out the checklist and paste the console outputs to the PR.

- [TDSB-logo.png] I've tested the code and ensured the outputs are the same as the outputs of reference codes.
- [TVDSB-logo.webp] I've checked the codes (formatting, comments, indentation, file header, etc) carefully.
- [WECDSB-logo.png] The code does not rely on a particular environment or IDE and can be executed on a standard system (http://tdsb.on.ca/).
