<h2 align="center"> Procedure </h2>

Two years ago, I shared the "Sword to Offer" series on LeetCode, which was loved and supported by many students. During the communication with readers, one of the most common questions I received was "how to start learning algorithms". I have gradually developed a strong interest in this question.

Brushing up on problems with a blank slate seems to be the most popular method, which is simple, direct and effective. Brushing questions is like playing the game of "minesweeper", students with strong self-learning ability can successfully remove the mines one by one, while students with insufficient foundation are likely to be blown up all over their heads and retreat in frustration. Reading through textbooks and books is also a common practice, but for job-seeking students, the graduation season, submitting resumes, and preparing for written tests and interviews have taken up most of their energy, and heavy books often become a daunting challenge.

If you are facing similar struggles, then luckily this book has found you. This book is my answer to this problem, if not the optimal solution, at least a positive attempt. Although this book is not enough for you to get an offer directly, it will guide you to explore the "knowledge map" of data structures and algorithms, bring you to understand the shapes, sizes, and distributions of different "landmines", and let you master various "demining methods". demining methods". With these skills, I believe you can be more comfortable to deal with the questions and read the literature, and gradually build up a complete knowledge system.
