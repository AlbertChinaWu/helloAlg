# About This Book

This open-source project aims to create a free, and beginner-friendly crash course on data structures and algorithms.

- The entire book uses animated illustrations to explain data structures and algorithms in a structured way. The content is clear, easy to understand, and features a smooth learning curve.
- All algorithm source codes can be executed with a single click, supporting languages like Python, C++, Java, C#, Go, Swift, JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart, Rust, C, Zig, etc.
- Readers are encouraged to help each other and progress together in the chapter discussion sections. Questions and comments are usually replied to within two days.

## Target Reader

If you are a beginner in algorithms, have never been exposed to them, or have some experience in problem-solving and have a vague understanding of data structures and algorithms, oscillating between understanding and not, then this book is tailor-made for you!

If you have already accumulated a certain amount of problem-solving experience, and are familiar with most types of problems, then this book can help you review and organize your algorithm knowledge system. The repository's source code can be used as a "problem-solving toolkit" or an "algorithm dictionary."

If you are an algorithm expert, we look forward to receiving your valuable suggestions, or [join us in creating](https://www.hello-algo.com/chapter_appendix/contribution/).

!!! success "Prerequisites"

    You need to have at least a basic understanding of one programming language and be able to read and write simple code.

## Content Structure

The main content of the book is shown in the following figure.

- **Complexity Analysis**: Evaluation dimensions and methods for data structures and algorithms. Methods for calculating time and space complexity, common types, examples, etc.
- **Data Structures**: Basic data types, and classification methods for data structures. Definitions, advantages and disadvantages, common operations, common types, typical applications, implementation methods, etc., for data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, heaps, graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Definitions, advantages and disadvantages, efficiency, application scenarios, problem-solving steps, and example problems for algorithms like search, sort, divide and conquer, backtracking, dynamic programming, greedy, etc.

## Acknowledgements

During the creation of this book, I received help from many people, including but not limited to:

- Thanks to my mentor at the company, Dr. Li Xi, who encouraged me in a conversation to "get moving fast," which solidified my determination to write this book;
- Thanks to my girlfriend Pao Pao, as the first reader of this book, for offering many valuable suggestions from the perspective of a beginner in algorithms, making this book more suitable for newbies;
- Thanks to Tengbao, Qibao, and Feibao for coming up with a creative name for this book, evoking everyone's fond memories of writing their first line of code "Hello World!";
- Thanks to Xiao Quan for providing professional help in intellectual property, which has played a significant role in the development of this open-source book;
- Thanks to Su Tong for designing a beautiful cover and logo for this book, and for patiently making multiple revisions under my insistence;
- Thanks to @squidfunk for providing writing and typesetting suggestions, as well as his developed open-source documentation theme [Material-for-MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/tree/master).

While writing, I read many textbooks and articles on data structures and algorithms. These works have provided excellent examples for this book, ensuring the accuracy and quality of its content. I hereby thank all the teachers and seniors for their outstanding contributions!

This book advocates a learning method that combines hands-on and mental exercises, inspired in this regard by ["Dive into Deep Learning"](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-zh). I highly recommend this excellent work to all readers.

**Heartfelt thanks to my parents, whose ongoing support and encouragement have allowed me to do this interesting work**.
