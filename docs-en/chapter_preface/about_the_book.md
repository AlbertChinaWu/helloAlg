# The Book

This open-source project aims to create a free, beginner-friendly crash course on data structures and algorithms.

- Animated illustrations, structured delivery for data structures and algorithms, with easy-to-understand content, and a smooth learning curve.
- Run code with just one click, supporting Java, C++, Python, Go, JS, TS, C#, Swift, Rust, Dart, Zig and other languages.
- Readers are encouraged to help each other in the discussion area for each section, questions and comments are usually answered within two days.

## Target Readers

If you are a beginner to algorithms, you have never learned algorithms before, or you have accumulated some experience in algorithms, but you only have a vague understanding of data structures and algorithms, and you are constantly jumping between "yep" and "hmm", then this book is for you!

If you have already accumulated some experience in algorithms and are familiar with most types of questions, then this book can help you review and organize your algorithm knowledge map, and the source code in our repository can be used as a "algorithm toolkit" or "algorithm cheat sheet".

If you are an algorithm expert, we look forward to receiving your valuable suggestions or [join us and collaborate](https://www.hello-algo.com/chapter_appendix/contribution/).

!!! success "Prerequisites"

    You should know how to write and read simple code in at least one programming language.

## Content Structure

The main contents of the book are shown in the figure below.

- **Complexity Analysis**: aspects and methods for evaluating data structures and algorithms. Methods of deriving time complexity and space complexity, with the common types, examples, etc.
- **Data Structures**: basic data types, classification methods of data structures. Definition, pros and cons, common operations, common types, typical applications, implementation methods of data structures such as array, linked list, stack, queue, hash table, tree, heap, graph, etc.
- **Algorithms**: definitions, pros and cons, efficiency, application scenarios, steps for solving questions, sample questions for algorithms such as search, sorting, divide and conquer, backtracking, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and more.

## Acknowledgements

During the creation of this book, I received help from many people, including but not limited to:

- Thank you to my mentor at the company, Dr. Xi Li, for encouraging me to "get moving" during one of our conversations, which strengthened my resolve to write this book.
- I would like to thank my girlfriend Bubbles for being the first reader of this book, and for making many valuable suggestions from the perspective of an algorithm whiz, making this book more suitable for beginners.
- Thanks to Tengbao, Qibao, and Feibao for coming up with a creative name for this book that evokes fond memories of writing the first line of code "Hello World!".
- Thanks to Sutong for designing the beautiful cover and logo for this book and patiently revising it many times under my OCD.
- Thanks to @squidfunk for writing layout suggestions and for developing the open source documentation theme [Material-for-MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/tree/master).

During the writing process, I read many textbooks and articles on data structures and algorithms. These works provide excellent models for this book and ensure the accuracy and quality of its contents. Thanks for all who came before me for their outstanding contributions!

This book promotes a hands-on approach to learning, and in this respect is heavily inspired by ["Dive into Deep Learning"](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-zh). I highly recommend this excellent book to all readers.

A heartfelt thank you to my parents, it is your constant support and encouragement that gives me the opportunity to do this fun-filled thing.
