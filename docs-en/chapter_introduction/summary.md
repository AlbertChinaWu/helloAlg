# Summary

- Algorithms are ubiquitous in our daily lives and are not a distant knowledge. In fact, we have learned many algorithms without even realizing it to solve life's problems, big and small.
- The principle of looking up a dictionary is consistent with the binary search algorithm. The binary search algorithm embodies the important algorithmic idea of divide and conquer.
- The process of sorting poker is very similar to the insertion sort algorithm. The insertion sort algorithm is suitable for sorting small data sets.
- The steps in currency change are essentially greedy algorithms, taking the best option that currently seems to be available at each step.
- An algorithm is a set of instructions or operational steps to solve a specific problem in a limited amount of time, while a data structure is the way data is organized and stored in a computer.
- Data structures and algorithms are closely intertwined. The data structure is the cornerstone of the algorithm, while the algorithm is the arena in which the data structure is utilized.
- We can analogize data structures and algorithms to putting together building blocks, where the blocks represent the data, the shapes and connections of the blocks represent the data structure, and the steps in putting the blocks together correspond to the algorithm.
