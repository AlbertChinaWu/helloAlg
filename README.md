## The Book

This project aims to create an open-source, free, and beginner-friendly tutorial on data structures and algorithms.

- The book uses animated illustrations to make the content clear, easy to understand, and provides a smooth learning curve, guiding beginners through the knowledge map of data structures and algorithms.
- The source code can be run with a single click, helping readers improve their programming skills, understand the working principles of algorithms, and the underlying implementation of data structures.
- We encourage readers to learn together, ask questions, and comment. Replies are usually received within two days.

> **Important**
>
> We are working on Chinese-to-English translation. For more information please see [#914](https://github.com/krahets/hello-algo/issues/914).

If this book is helpful to you, please give it a Star :star: in the top right corner of the page to show your support. Thank you!

## Praise

> “An accessible and easy-to-understand introduction to data structures and algorithms, guiding readers to learn actively and hands-on. Highly recommended for beginners in algorithms.”
>
> **—— Junhui Deng, Professor of Computer Science at Tsinghua University**

> “If I had 'Hello Algorithm' when I was learning data structures and algorithms, it would have been 10 times easier!”
>
> **—— Mu Li, Senior Principal Scientist at Amazon**
